# gyro-squadron-45 — Project Diary

*Phase-by-phase log. Entries append, never rewrite. Nothing is done until its wall is green twice.*

## 2026-09-22 13:19 — Milestone 1 — tilt as tested math

The riskiest part first: gravity-truth tilt steering with calibration, dead zone, quadratic curve, bounds clamps, touch fallback — all as an injectable input source CI can drive without a phone. 17+17 plus a full-tilt sway soak.

## 2026-09-22 13:19 — Milestone 2 — the Act 1 arsenal

Four weapon tiers, kill-charged Super Shot, bombs, fighter and bomber brains, the fortress boss in two phases, a 55-second escalating stage with clear tally. 24+24 green; the eat-everything run dies honestly and retries.

## 2026-09-22 13:22 — Lore recovered

A found document from the world (see LORE.md) and its sketch now live in this repo's diary_images. Oddworld law: the game's instructions are artifacts of its own world.

## 2026-09-22 23:51 — ROADMAP: M3→M6 to itch

Steps: 1) M3 (building now): powerup gating + escorts + Act 2 (jet + turret + proto_mech boss). 2) M4: Act 3 futuristic content (UFO scout + mecha_transform enemies + alien_core final boss with 3 phases). 3) M5: title screen + audio + difficulty tiers. 4) M6: full verify-retry pass across all acts + export. 5) itch page + butler push + critic playtest. DONE: M1 M2 green (82 checks), repo live, lore (pilot letter) + sketches complete.

## 2026-09-22 23:52 — ROADMAP to itch

1) M3 (building): escorts + Act2. 2) M4: Act3 + alien_core boss. 3) M5: title + audio + difficulty. 4) M6: full verify + export + itch + critic. DONE: M1+M2 green (82 checks).

## 2026-09-23 00:28 — Milestone 3 — the gate, the wingmen, the black budget

Spec law lands: 3 pickups bank one weapon tier (the v1 +1-per-pickup is gone), 22% drops verified statistically on the seeded stream. Tier 3 arms option planes — small copies of the P-51 orbiting at a fixed radius, firing one parallel stream every volley, max 2 at tier 4. Act 2 opens after the fortress falls: the ACT 2: BLACK BUDGET card, 55 s of mixed waves (act-1 fighters/bombers plus unmarked jets diving fast with 2-shot energy-bolt bursts and edge-pinned energy turrets that sweep a telegraph line onto the horizontal and burn the row), then the proto_mech — 70 hp, lobbed missile arcs, telegraphed laser sweeps, and at 35 it runs both at once. 18 new checks + a 25 s replay that weaves act 1 on super+bomb, gates the tier, forces the clear and rides the banner into act 2. Wall: tilt 17x2, m2 24x2, m3 18x2, three replays, full run 0 errors. Act-2 sprites are procedural silhouettes (original_assets law) — the art pass can land later without touching a test.
